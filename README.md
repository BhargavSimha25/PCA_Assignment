# PCA Assignment 📊

Welcome to the **PCA Assignment** repository! This project provides resources and tools for understanding and implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a powerful dimensionality reduction technique widely used in data analysis and machine learning.

## 📚 Overview

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a technique used to reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining as much variability as possible. This repository contains everything you need to understand and apply PCA, including explanations, examples, and code for hands-on practice.
