# PCA Assignment
Welcome to the PCA Assignment repository! This project is focused on applying Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the dimensionality of datasets and identify the most significant features that capture the underlying structure of the data.

### Introduction
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a powerful technique used in data science and machine learning to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets. By transforming the data into a set of orthogonal components, PCA helps in identifying the directions (principal components) that capture the maximum variance in the data, thereby simplifying the analysis while retaining essential information.

### Assignment Objectives
The key objectives of this PCA assignment are:

Data Preparation: Standardize the dataset to ensure that each feature contributes equally to the analysis.
PCA Application: Apply PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and identify the principal components.
Variance Analysis: Analyze the explained variance to determine the number of principal components to retain.
Visualization: Visualize the principal components and their contribution to understanding the data structure.

### Examples
The repository includes examples and case studies demonstrating the use of PCA:

Basic PCA: Applying PCA to a simple dataset and interpreting the results.
Explained Variance: Analyzing the variance explained by each principal component.
2D and 3D Plots: Visualizing the data in reduced dimensions for better interpretation.
